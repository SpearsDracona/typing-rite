# Typing Rite

A deceptively simple typing game with a creepy twist.

## Overview

Typing Rite begins as a straightforward typing game - but not everything is as it seems. As you type, strange things begin to happen. The text seems to respond to the player's input, with multiple voices trying to steer the player in different directions. Multiple endings are possible, depending on how you play, and whom you decide to trust.

This is a text-based browser game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features (Planned)

- Typing feedback with live highlighting for correct and incorrect input
- A branching story that evolves based on player choices and skill-based challenges
- Dynamic responses to player behavior
- Subtle glitch effects and multiple narrative voices
