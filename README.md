# Typing Rite

A deceptively simple typing game with a creepy twist.

## Overview

Typing Rite begins as a straightforward typing game - but not everything is as it seems. As you type, strange things begin to happen. The text seems to respond to the player's input, with multiple voices trying to steer the player in different directions. Multiple endings are possible, depending on how you play, and whom you decide to trust.

This is a text-based browser game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Curent Status

This is a work in progress. I'm currently learning JavaScript and building this project to practice JavaScript, CSS, and Git skills.

## Learning Goals

- Practice JavaScript basics
- Practice using event listeners and DOM manipulation
- Get more comfortable using Git and GitHub
- Experiment with design and layout using CSS
- Practice using CSS features such as Flexbox for layout and transitions and keyframes for animation

## Features (Planned)

- Typing feedback with live highlighting for correct and incorrect input
- A branching story with multiple narrative voices
